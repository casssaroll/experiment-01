        The earliest memory I have of using the internet was in 2010 when I was only 4. I remember always watching YouTube music videos on my iPod. I was specifically obsessed with rewatching Kesha’s 2009 TiK ToK MV and Lady Gaga’s 2010 Telephone MV. I was also obsessed with Gwen Stefani's Hollaback Girl (2004) and Sweet Escape (2006). I think there will always be something special about early music videos like these that MVs nowadays tend to lack. They used to be so much more fun and colorful, and I could really appreciate the creativity. They were also made in a way that will always be memorable and iconic whereas nowadays I can’t remember the last MV I watched that really stood out to me.
